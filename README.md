# Electron Curse

## Why
The reason I made this is because I recently had to move to linux to learn ruby, but had some friends who use the curse client and didn't want to keep opening chrome so I made this.

## Rant
The original curse web app was already written in electron, so idk why curse inc won't just port the program to linux and os x since they're player base whom i assume are minecraft and league of legends players are also on these platforms. 

## Status
Due to feedback from the linux gaming community and their distrust of Curse Inc. due to past transgressions. I guess no one really needed this client so I probably won't try to port over the features of the curse client. 

Caveat: if a problem does arise with the program, just post post an issue, i might fix it :D

## This project is dead and no longer works, more coming in the future. 
I'm currently exploring ways to port over functionality of the twitch client without reverse engineering. I'm only a student can't afford legal battle tee hee. 

Since Discord Exists, the chance of me to continue this project is nill, we had a good run, and if twitch feels like they don't want to make their application available to the linux community then who are we to tell them what to do with their creation.
