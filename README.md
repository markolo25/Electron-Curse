# Electron Curse

# Why would you make this, there's already a Curse Client
The reason I made this is because I recently had to move to linux to learn ruby, but had some friends who use the curse client and didn't want to keep opening chrome so I made this.

#Rant
The original curse web app was already written in electron, so idk why curse inc won't just port the program to linux and os x since they're player base whom i assume are minecraft and league of legends players are also on these platforms. 

#TODO
Packing for OS X and Debian
Auto-login
Game detection
