#Electron Curse

#Why
The reason I made this is because I recently had to move to linux to learn ruby, but had some friends who use the curse client and didn't want to keep opening chrome so I made this.

#Rant
The original curse web app was already written in electron, so idk why curse inc won't just port the program to linux and os x since they're player base whom i assume are minecraft and league of legends players are also on these platforms. 

#Status
Due to feedback from the linux gaming community and their distrust of Curse Inc. due to past transgressions. I guess no one really needed this client so I probably won't try to port over the features of the curse client. 

Caveat: if a problem does arise with the program, just post post an issue, i might fix it :D

#TODO
Game detection(Cancelled)
